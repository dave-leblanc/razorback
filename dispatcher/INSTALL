DEPENDENCIES
============
To run Razorback you need the following additional server components:

mysql
activemq (Requires a JDK)
memcached

To compile the API and the dispatcher you need:
libuuid
libmagic
libmemcached
libssl
libconfig
libpcre
libmysqlclient
make
libtool
autoconf
automake
libcli

Other dependencies, depending on the nuggets you choose include:
json
clamav
wine
fam & libfam
jython

MYSQL
=====
In dipatcher/share are two files, razorback.sql and razorback-with-data.sql.  The
easiest way to get mysql setup is to cd into that directory and launch mysql.  Then:

create database razorback;
use razorback;
source razorback.sql;
source razorback-with-data.sql;

ACTIVEMQ
========
ActiveMQ is the queue server and runs on Java.  You can download the queue server
from http://activemq.apache.org/download.html.  As of the creation of this document
we have tested at ActiveMQ 5.5.0.

There are two modifications that need to be made.  The first is to edit the activemq.xml
file in the conf directory.  In the transportConnectors property, the entry needs to look
like the following:

        <transportConnectors>
            <transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616"/>
            <transportConnector name="stomp" uri="stomp://0.0.0.0:61612?transport.closeAsync=false"/>
            <transportConnector name="stomp+nio" uri="stomp+nio://0.0.0.0:61613?transport.closeAsync=false"/>
        </transportConnectors>

Also, in some environments you need to force the activemq server to bind to the IPv4 stack.
We do this by modifying the ACTIVEMQ_OPTS parameter in the bin/activemq file.  Initially it
probably looks like this:

ACTIVEMQ_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms256M -Xmx256M"

It should have the "-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true" switch added to it:

ACTIVEMQ_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms256M -Xmx256M -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"

Once this is done you can start the queue server with "bin/activemq start"

MEMCACHED
=========
The default installation and options should work with the install.

CONFIGURE
=========
To following configuration line will get you started (this will place
the files in /razorback, change the --prefix and --with-api values as
necessary:

./configure --prefix=/razorback --enable-debug --disable-officeCat --disable-snort --disable-master-nugget-check \
--with-api=/razorback/api --disable-fsMonitor --disable-virusTotal

This will install the API, dispatcher and the following nuggets:

Collector:
fsWalk, fileInject

Detection:
logNuggget
archiveInflate
clamAV  (Make sure you've correctly installed the ClamAV library)

CONF FILES
=========
So, in the etc/razorback directory are a number of sample conf directories.
We do this so conf/make/make install doesn't wipe out your conf.  So first
time through you need to copy each .sample file to just a .conf file:

cp rzb.conf.sample rzb.conf

Also, make sure you copy magic.sample to magic:

cp magic.sample magic

Once this is done, you need to configure certain parts of the system.

dispatcher.conf
---------------
Enter the information for the database.  Also ensure the GlobalCache
section is correct for your memcached server.  Finally, change the
user/pass/enable combination for the console.  The storage parameters
can be left at default for now.

rzb.conf
--------
Modify the MessageQueue section to reflect your activemq settings.
All other values can be left at default.

file_log.conf
-------------
The LogFile value is where you want the log nugget to write out the
log in <timestamp>,<datatype uuid>,<datatype>,<size> format.
The DataBlockDir directory is where the captured files will be stored.

THATS IT
========
You should now be able to launch the master nugget:

bin/masterNugget -d

and inject files into the system:

bin/fileInject --file=testfile.pdf

Check the output of the dispatcher and master nugget processes to make
sure everything is going well.  The database should be populated with
the datablock type, size, sha and status.

SCRIPTNUGGET
============
After installing the script nugget you will need to install the language bindings for the scripting language you are using.

For example, the ruby gem for the Razorback scripting nugget is in ./razorbacktm/bindings/ruby.  From that directory run 'gem build razorback.gemspec'.  This will build out the gem, allowing you to run 'sudo gem install scriptNugget-ruby-0.3.0.gem'.
