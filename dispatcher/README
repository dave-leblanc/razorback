Razorback DefCon Release
========================

Platform:
Ubuntu Linux version 9.10, nothing is guaranteed to work on anything
else at the moment, if ever. In fact, no guarantees that it will work
for you regardless. But hey, it'll be a fun ride trying to make it
function though right?

Quick:
configure
make
make install

Long:
Debugging can be enabled by typing ./configure --enable-debug
Run ./configure --help for all of the available options

Requirements:
m libraries
pthread libraries
uuid libraries
mysql development libraries
ssl libraries for the API
magic libraries for the API
pcre libraries for the sample nuggets

Database:
Right now, MySQL is the only supported database. The schema can be found
in the doc directory. Future releases will incorporate Hadoop support.

TODO:

API:
The install target installs a package metadata file in ${libdir}/pkgconfig (/usr/local/lib/pkkconfig by default).
The pkg-config utility can be used to acquire the correct CFLAGS and LDFLAGS needed to compile a nugget.

pkg-config --cflags razorback
pkg-config --libs razorback

The PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro can be used to acquire the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS from within a nugget configure script.

PKG_CHECK_MODULES([RZB], [razorback])

The above call will provide RZB_CFLAGS and RZB_LDFLAGS to use in the autoconf/automake process.
