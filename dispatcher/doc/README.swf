SWF Nugget
----------

-- Overview -- 

SWF Nugget is a Razorback Detection Nugget that scans Flash files collected by 
Razorback Collector Nuggets. SWF Nugget decompresses (as necessary) and 
parses Flash files to detect attacks exploiting known vulnerabilities. 

The scan results are sent back to Razorback Dispatcher to correlate with other
Razorback Nuggets. 

-- Status --

Currently, it detects the following malicious Flash file that exploits the
following CVEs:

CVE-2005-2628
CVE-2006-0323
CVE-2007-0071
CVE-2007-5400

-- Future Work --

* Include more detections
* Research ActionScript interpretation
* Implement embedded data extraction such as JPEG, PNG, GIF and send back to
  Razorback Dispatcher
