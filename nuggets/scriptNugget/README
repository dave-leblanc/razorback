After installing the script nugget you will need to install the language bindings for the scripting language you are using.

For example, the ruby gem for the Razorback scripting nugget is in ./razorbacktm/bindings/ruby.  From that directory run 'gem build razorback.gemspec'.  This will build out the gem, allowing you to run 'sudo gem install scriptNugget-ruby-0.3.0.gem'.
