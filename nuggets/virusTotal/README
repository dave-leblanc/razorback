This nugget checks the virustotal api for the md5 of the submitted file.
If the file is found, the short data of the alert will have all of the results
from the json response.  Currently, this nugget does not submit the actual file.

To install the nugget do the usual:

./configure
make
make install

Then copy the installed etc/razorback/rzb_virustotal.conf.sample to etc/razorback/rzb_virustotal.conf, and update the API_KEY to your key.
