License:
    Razorback (tm) is the copyrighted work of Sourcefire, Inc. (c) 2011. Razorback is also a 
    trademark of Sourcefire, Inc. ("Sourcefire" or "we") All rights reserved.

    This program is free software -- you may use it, redistribute and/or modify it under 
    the terms of the GNU General Public License, Version 2, as published by the Free 
    Software Foundation, with the clarifications and exceptions described below.  This 
    guarantees your right to use, modify, and redistribute this software under certain 
    conditions.  If you wish to embed Razorback technology into proprietary software or 
    hardware or use Razorback technology to provide services we sell alternative 
    licenses (contact razorback-license@sourcefire.com). 

    Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "works based on the program" 
    and "work derived from the program", yet it does not provide a detailed definition 
    of such terms.  To avoid misunderstandings, we consider an application to 
    constitute a "work based on the program" and "a work derived from the program" 
    for the purpose of this license if it does any of the following:
     
     - Integrates source code from Razorback.
     - Reads or includes Razorback copyrighted data files.
     - Executes Razorback and parses the results (as opposed to typical shell or 
       execution-menu apps, which simply display raw Razorback output and so are not 
       derivative works).
     - Integrates/includes/aggregates Razorback into a proprietary executable installer, 
       such as those produced by InstallShield.
     - Links to a library or executes a program that does any of the above.

    The term "Razorback" should be taken to also include any portions or derived 
    works of Razorback.  This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our 
    interpretation of derived works with some common examples.  Our interpretation 
    applies only to Razorback - we don't speak for other people's GPL works.

    If you have any questions about the GPL licensing restrictions on using Razorback in 
    non-GPL works, we would be happy to help.  As mentioned above, we also offer 
    alternative licenses to integrate Razorback into proprietary applications or 
    hardware or to allow you to provide services using Razorback. 

    If you received these files with a written license agreement or contract with 
    Sourcefire stating terms other than the terms above, then that alternative license 
    agreement takes precedence over these comments.   

    Source code is provided to this software because we believe users have a right to 
    know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it.  This also allows you 
    to audit the software for security holes.  Source code also allows you to port 
    Razorback to new platforms, fix bugs, and add new features.  You are highly 
    encouraged to send your changes to [INSERT EMAIL/URL SITE] for possible 
    incorporation into the main distribution.  By sending these changes or code to 

                 https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/razorbacktm/

    or one of the razorbacktm-dev and razorbacktm-users development mailing lists: 

    (1) you grant Sourcefire a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, world-wide, 
    non-exclusive, unrestricted right and license to reuse, modify, distribute, sublicense
    and relicense the changes and code you submit, and (2) with respect to any patents
    you own relating to the changes and code you submit, or for patents you can license
    without payment to a third party, you grant Sourcefire a perpetual, irrevocable,
    world-wide, royalty-free right and license under such patents and patent rights
    to make, have made, use, sell, have sold and to otherwise directly and indirectly
    distribute products that include the changes and code you submit to us.

    Razorback will always be available as open source software; this is important 
    because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for other 
    free software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also occasionally relicense the 
    code to third parties as discussed above.  If you wish to specify special license 
    conditions for your contributions, just say so when you send them.
